# graph
Implement Graph Data structure. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list

## Challenge
deapthFirst() search in the graph
Approach & Efficiency
i used class

## BIG O
graph
deapthFirst Method
space --> Big O = O(n) --> space varies as number of nodes increase or decrease
time --> Big O = O(n) --> time varies as number of nodes increase or decrease
