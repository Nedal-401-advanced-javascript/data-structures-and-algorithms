# Challenge Summary
Linked list is type of the data structure, I build a module in the previous challenge and make it available for this challenge. this challeng should use the LL to Zip two linked lists.
## Challenge Description
Write a function called zipLists which takes two linked lists as arguments. Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the head of the zipped list. Try and keep additional space down to O(1). You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.
## Approach & Efficiency

creating new linked list, time O(n) and space O(1)
