# Singly Linked List
 there is only one reference, and the reference points to the Next node in a linked list.
## Challenge
create node and linked list classes and make functionality to fill the list and to check if there is any specific number as a output of the value input and add a method to print the hole list
## Approach & Efficiency
make the node class to make the structur of the node and class to structure the list and its methods 

## API
there are three methods can use by Linked list class:
1. insert: which is check if there is any value in the list if it is emptey , will add the new value as  a head for the list, else will add the value as a tail

2. includes: it looking for a specific value as input if it is one of the nodes values and return true and false if there is not.

3. toString: it printes all the values in the linked list as following:
>         // "{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"
