# Challenge Summary
Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array. If they are not equal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half, again taking the middle element to compare to the target value, and repeating this until the target value is found. 
## Challenge Description

## Approach & Efficiency
trying to eliminat the half of the array after spesifing the middle every eteration until the key found
